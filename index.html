        U.S. residents are missing many, many billions of dollars in unclaimed property.
        <br>
        Much of this missing property is turned over to state governments and treasuries, after designated periods
        of time have passed.
        <br>
        Americans often are not aware that they are the owners or beneficiaries of unclaimed property, in spite of
        state government efforts to publicize “missing money” holdings.]
        <br>
        Or – if an individual or business does know or suspect that their property is missing – they don’t know how
        to locate it or claim it. The research and claim process can seem too complicated or overwhelming.
        <br>
        This is where Simple Asset Return Services comes in.
        We specialize in locating the rightful owners of unclaimed financial property, and reuniting the owners with
        their money.
        <br>
        Our goal is to streamline the claim process for our clients.

        Simple Asset Return Services reviews government files of unclaimed accounts and assets in an effort to
        reunite these funds with their rightful owners. These accounts are considered “unclaimed” if there has been
        no activity or contact with the account owner for a year or longer, depending on the type of account and
        related state laws.
        <br>
        For instance, a bank account holder may move but overlook updating his mailing address with the bank. If
        bank statements or other correspondence are returned by the post office as undeliverable, regulations
        require the bank to make additional attempts to locate the account holder. If the bank cannot reestablish
        contact with the account holder after a specified period of time has passed, the account must be turned over
        to the state for safekeeping.
        <br>
        States have the responsibility to attempt to find the rightful owners, but so much property goes unclaimed
        every year that state offices are overwhelmed. Simple Asset Return Services researches state unclaimed
        property records and matches the records with publicly available contact information. When we find a
        match, we send a letter offering our help in reclaiming your property. We work on a contingency basis – we
        don’t get paid until your property is returned to you.
