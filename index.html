        U.S. residents are missing many, many billions of dollars in unclaimed property.
        Much of this missing property is turned over to state governments and treasuries, after designated periods
        of time have passed.
        Americans often are not aware that they are the owners or beneficiaries of unclaimed property, in spite of
        state government efforts to publicize “missing money” holdings.
        Or – if an individual or business does know or suspect that their property is missing – they don’t know how
        to locate it or claim it. The research and claim process can seem too complicated or overwhelming.

        This is where Simple Asset Return Services comes in.
        We specialize in locating the rightful owners of unclaimed financial property, and reuniting the owners with
        their money.
        Our goal is to streamline the claim process for our clients.
