                    <span></span>U.S. residents are missing many, many <b><i>billions of dollars</i></b> in unclaimed property.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span></span>Much of this missing property is turned over to state governments and treasuries, after designated periods
                    of time have passed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span></span>Americans often are not aware that they are the owners or beneficiaries of unclaimed property, in spite of
                    state government efforts to publicize “missing money” holdings.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span></span>Or – if an individual or business does know or suspect that their property is missing – they don’t know how
                    to locate it or claim it. The research and claim process can seem too complicated or overwhelming.

                    <span></span>This is where Simple Asset Return Services comes in.

                    <span></span>Simple Asset Return Services reviews government files of unclaimed accounts and assets in an effort to
                    reunite these funds with their rightful owners. These accounts are considered “unclaimed” if there has been
                    no activity or contact with the account owner for a year or longer, depending on the type of account and
                    related state laws.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span></span>For instance, a bank account holder may move but overlook updating his mailing address with the bank. If
                    bank statements or other correspondence are returned by the post office as undeliverable, regulations
                    require the bank to make additional attempts to locate the account holder. If the bank cannot reestablish
                    contact with the account holder after a specified period of time has passed, the account must be turned over
                    to the state for safekeeping.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span></span>States have the responsibility to attempt to find the rightful owners, but so much property goes unclaimed
                    every year that state offices are overwhelmed. Simple Asset Return Services researches state unclaimed
                    property records and matches the records with publicly available contact information. When we find a
                    match, we send a letter offering our help in reclaiming your property. We work on a contingency basis – we
                    don’t get paid until your property is returned to you.
